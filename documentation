        Startup Configuration File: Enable the server to load settings from a configuration file (port, max threads, logging level, etc.).

    Thread Management:
        Configurable Thread Pool: Allow the user to define the maximum number of worker threads in a thread pool.
        Implement proper thread pooling to reuse threads across multiple requests, rather than creating/destroying threads on each request.
        Load-based Thread Scaling: Adjust the number of worker threads dynamically based on server load.

    Signal Handling:
        Implement signal handling (e.g., SIGTERM, SIGHUP) to support graceful shutdowns and reload configurations without dropping connections.
        Handle shutdown and restart signals properly (clean up resources, save state if necessary).

    CPU and Memory Usage Monitoring:
        Periodically log memory and CPU usage to monitor performance and detect potential memory leaks or CPU saturation.

Milestone 10: Advanced Logging and Monitoring

    Goal: Build a comprehensive logging and monitoring system that integrates with the operating system and offers more detailed logging for debugging and security purposes.

Requirements:

    Logging Levels:

        Log errors in a separate log file or stream to help with troubleshooting (e.g., failed connections, failed file reads).

    Monitoring Endpoints (Optional):
        Provide endpoints to monitor server health (/health) and metrics (e.g., /metrics for system statistics like CPU usage, memory consumption, open file descriptors, etc.).

Milestone 11: Command-Line Interface and Configuration

        Reduce logging verbosity in this mode (WARN and ERROR only).
        Reduce or eliminate multithreading (single-threaded mode) to minimize memory footprint on constrained devices.

    Static Configuration for Low Power Devices:
        Allow configuration files to statically define server options to reduce runtime decisions (e.g., fixed thread pool size, logging, and response caching).
        Disable features like request pipelining and chunked transfer encoding if not necessary in limited environments.

    Run as Background Process:
        Allow running as a background daemon or service on embedded systems without user intervention.
        Implement watchdog or keep-alive mechanisms to automatically restart the server in case of crashes.

    Cross-Compilation for Embedded Systems:

    Concurrency Limits and Load Management:
        Allow users to set maximum connection limits and gracefully handle overload situations (e.g., queue incoming connections, drop connections when load exceeds limits).

    Load Balancer Compatibility:
        Ensure compatibility with common load balancers (e.g., NGINX, HAProxy) by handling forwarded headers (X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP) and using proper timeouts for backend connections.

    Documentation and Help System:
        Provide comprehensive documentation for users and developers, including API references and configuration file samples.
        Include a --help command to display CLI options and their usage.

    Testing and CI Integration:

        Recommend optimal settings based on hardware and network conditions.

Milestone 15: Modularize Server into a Reusable Library (Optional)

    Goal: Make the HTTP server a reusable C++ library so that other programs can embed the server functionality. This step provides a flexible way for developers to add HTTP server capabilities into their own applications.

        Separate Core Components:
            Extract the core components (e.g., request parsing, response handling, connection management) into modular and reusable classes.
            Ensure that these components are decoupled and can be used independently (e.g., request parser without the server).

    API for Embedding:
        Design a clean API to allow external applications to:
            Start and stop the server.
            Handle incoming requests programmatically.

    Header-Only Library (Optional):
        Optionally, provide a header-only version of the library to simplify usage for developers, enabling easy inclusion without additional compilation steps.

    Dynamic Configuration and Extensibility:
        Allow embedding programs to configure server settings (port, logging, thread pool size) via API calls.
        Make it easy to extend functionality (e.g., adding custom authentication mechanisms, custom request processing logic).

    Error Handling and Callbacks:
        Provide callback mechanisms for error handling, logging, and monitoring, allowing the embedding program to manage these features.

    Documentation:
        Provide comprehensive API documentation so developers can easily integrate the HTTP server into their programs.
        Offer usage examples for typical scenarios (e.g., running the server in the background, registering custom routes).

Milestone 16: REST API Integration (Optional)

    Goal: Extend the server to support easy integration with REST APIs, making it suitable for building API-driven services.

Requirements:

    RESTful Route Management:
        Implement a routing mechanism to map HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to specific API endpoints.
        Allow users to define dynamic routes with parameters (e.g., /api/v1/users/{id}).

    JSON Parsing and Response:
        Integrate a lightweight JSON parser (such as nlohmann/json or RapidJSON) to handle incoming JSON data.
        Ensure that the server can easily parse JSON request bodies and generate JSON responses.

    REST API Middleware:
        Provide middleware hooks to handle common REST API tasks:
            Authentication (e.g., API keys, JWT).
            Request validation (validate JSON payloads or query parameters).
            CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers to support web applications.

    HTTP Status Code Mapping:
        Automatically map responses to proper HTTP status codes (200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error, etc.) based on REST API best practices.

    Error Handling for REST APIs:
        Implement a standardized error response format (e.g., JSON object with error and message fields) for REST API errors.
        Provide structured error logging for API request failures.

    REST API Documentation (Optional):
        Add a mechanism to auto-generate REST API documentation (e.g., via Swagger or similar tools) based on registered routes and method signatures.

    Support for Versioned APIs:
        Enable support for versioning API routes (e.g., /api/v1/resource, /api/v2/resource).
